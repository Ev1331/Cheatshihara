Electronics engineering project for the course "Image Processing II" (1st year of master) at ECAM Brussels, 2023-2024.

## Description
This program uses OpenCV and PyTesseract to break the most commonly used plates from the 1917 Ishihara color blindness test (plates 1 to 17 and 22 to 25, or digits only). 
Best results are obtained with an external webcam, good-quality prints of the plates, and normal lighting conditions. Some colors may be harder to decode and may therefore require multiple trials.

## Instructions
When the Ishihara plate fits the green circle, press space to compute colors. Press space again to return to live view, and ESC to exit the program.
